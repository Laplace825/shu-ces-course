## `CMake`

if you want to use `CMake` to build the project, you can use the following commands in the root directory of the project:

```shell
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
```

After that, you can find the executable file in the `bin` directory.

## `run.sh`

if you are using a bash like shell, you are lucky.Just run the script and input what you want to run.**But** this just runs well in Linux.
